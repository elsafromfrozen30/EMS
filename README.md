# Elective Management System
An elective management system which backed the process of selecting electives for a particular
university or organization. It had both front end which shows the complete UI and as well as the backend which had stored all the data into their respective databases. Few testing methods were also implemented for debugging in order to prevent silly misconceptions.
Mainly looked into the Jira management, UML diagrams, Front end development and Testing.
